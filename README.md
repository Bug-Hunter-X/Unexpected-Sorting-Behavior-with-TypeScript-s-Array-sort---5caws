This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to the Array.sort() method and a custom comparison function. The bug arises when the comparison function doesn't explicitly handle cases where the input values are of different types, resulting in unexpected sorting outcomes.  The `bug.ts` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version with detailed explanations.
